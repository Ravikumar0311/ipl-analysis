# Features
‚Ä¢ **Business Problem**

The IPL is one of the most-watched cricket leagues globally. However, its extensive data‚Äîranging from player stats to venue performance‚Äîcan be overwhelming to interpret without visual assistance.

Key questions like:

‚Ä¢ Which teams dominated in particular season?

‚Ä¢ How do toss decisions impact win probability?

‚Ä¢ Who were the top performers with the bat and ball?

‚Ä¢ Which venues favoured chasing vs. defending?

are challenging to answer from raw CSVs.

‚Ä¢ **Goal of the Dashboard**

To deliver an interactive IPL report that:

‚Ä¢ Highlights key batting and bowling performances by player.

‚Ä¢ Explores win trends by toss decision, venue, and result type.

‚Ä¢ Provides team-level summaries for a season.

‚Ä¢ Helps users understand contextual success factors (e.g., pitch, toss, player).
